This repository contains a demonstration for the platform [CLIMADA](https://github.com/CLIMADA-project/climada_python) 
version 2.1.

The demo demonstrates how to compute impact of tropical cyclones using as exposure the LitPop layer, as hazard windspeed maps derived from historical IBTrACS records and a tracks perturbation algorithm, and as exposures the impact function calibrate for the storm Emanuel (2011). In addition, a simple climate change sceanrio and an adaptation example are shown.
